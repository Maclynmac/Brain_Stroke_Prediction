<strong> Brain_Stroke_Prediction</strong>

<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  
<li>Health Dataset Utilization: Utilizes medical data attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and more to model stroke risk.</li>

<li>Machine Learning Implementation: Covers ML methods likely including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers.</li>

<li>Data Preprocessing Steps: Performs cleaning, null-value handling, encoding, normalization, and possibly balancing/resampling.</li>

<li>Performance Evaluation: Presents results using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall/sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix.</li> 

<li.Working Demo or GUI: Features a user interface or live demonstration where inputs trigger stroke risk predictions.</li>

<li>Open‑Source Availability: Provides a GitHub link for accessing complete code, datasets, and documentation.</li>

</ul>
